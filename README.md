Methodology 

### Use phenvar to exctarct polymorphisms associated with AMD from the literature 
### GenomicRobots will combine sequence data from the AREDS DB with SNPs associated with the disease from the public databases to produce a list of relevant SNPs
### Curate candidates from 1a and 1b to create final list of genotype features

## From the AREDS DB extract the phenotype data: 
	(a) Control/drusden/AMD/GA
	(b) Exam data (as in “variables” section of the dbGAP link)

### Use sub clustering of the phenotype data to extract the labels to be used in a model that links phenotype/genotype for AMD
