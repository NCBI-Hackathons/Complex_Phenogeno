## What is complex disease?

Unlike illnesses such as sickle cell anemia or cystic fibrosis, where dys-regulation or mutation of a single gene can completely explain--and is responsible for--disease onset, the causes of [complex diseases](https://report.nih.gov/NIHfactsheets/ViewFactSheet.aspx?csid=42) cannot be easily deciphered using simple mendelian heredity rules. It is actually the majority of non-infectious diseases (and, indeed, the majority of [biological traits](https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/trait_%28biology%29.htm)) that fall into this category, cancer, cardiovascular conditions, and obesity being all but a few examples.

### Why are complex diseases so hard to understand?

From a biological perspective, complex diseases can be understood as the effect that combinations of mutations have on multiple pathways; different mutations affect different pathways and all together contribute to the onset and severity of the disease. Moreover, certain environmental and behavioral factors (e.g. radiation exposure, smoking, reduced vitamin intake) might further contribute to disrupting these pathways, deteriorating (or enabling) the observed adverse outcomes, even when the mutational burden for the disorder is not too high. Because [multiple pathways are usually involved in complex disease](https://www.genome.gov/10000865/), the symptoms are also, typically, complex, comprising of a collection of distinct phenotypes that are being monitored and used in diagnosis.

### The promise for personalized medicine and current limitations

With the introduction and readily adoption of high-throughput methods that scan the entire genome for mutations (initially [microarray hybridization](https://www.genome.gov/10000533/dna-microarray-technology/) and now [genome sequencing](https://www.genome.gov/10001177/dna-sequencing-fact-sheet/)) we now have the means to uncover the various mutations that underlie complex diseases. Genome-wide association studies ([GWAS](https://www.genome.gov/26525384/catalog-of-published-genomewide-association-studies/)) are using statistics to uncover relationships between mutations and pathologic genotypes. The idea is simple: before we are able to study how different mutations are affecting disease, we need to discover them. This is the first step to [personalized medicine](https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/what-we-do/nih-turning-discovery-into-health/personalized-medicine).

## Complex Pheno/Geno

There has now been more than ten years, and throusands of publications, of GWAS (and other) studies that have discovered hundreds of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with disease. Taking advantage of this existing knowledge generated in the lab, the goal of Complex Pheno/Geno is to restrict the genome space examined, potentially lowering the costs of personilized medicine, and at the same time exploring models that can offer good explanatory power to the observed diagnostic outcomes.
